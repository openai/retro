The code is heavily reliant on MarathonMan's CEN64 RSP implementation, as well as CXD4's RSP implementation.

MIPS core: Rewritten from scratch
CP0: Near copy-pasta from CEN64
CP2: Near copy-pasta from CEN64
LS pipe: Near copy-pasta from CXD4
Mupen64plus glue code: Reused most of CXD4.
Lightning jitter interface: Written from scratch

The plugin's focus is to support dynamic recompilation for performance,
instead of being pure interpreters as CEN64 and CXD4's implementations are.
