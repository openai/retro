# Gym Retro

Gym Retro lets you turn classic video games into [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments for Reinforcement Learning and comes with integrations for ~1000 games.  It uses various emulators that support the [Libretro API](https://www.libretro.com/index.php/api/), making it fairly easy to add new emulators.

Supported platforms:

- Windows 7, 8, 10
- macOS 10.12 (Sierra), 10.13 (High Sierra), 10.14 (Mojave)
- Linux (manylinux1)

Supported Pythons:

- 3.5
- 3.6
- 3.7

Each game integration has files listing memory locations for in-game variables, reward functions based on those variables, episode end conditions, savestates at the beginning of levels and a file containing hashes of ROMs that work with these files.

Please note that ROMs are not included and you must obtain them yourself.  Most ROM hashes are sourced from their respective No-Intro SHA-1 sums.
